# Benchf

./benchf host port amount tasks [Nchf requests]
Request content is from Nchf example (unusable) and always the same.
Update/release use the identities from create.
Create always replace session identities (create create, and the first identities are lost).
Example:
 ./benchf localhost 4000 1 1 create update update release
